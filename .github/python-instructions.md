# Python Instructions

- Use Python 3.11 or later
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines strictly
- Use type hints for all function signatures, class attributes, and variables
- Use `from __future__ import annotations` for forward references when needed
- Prefer dataclasses or Pydantic models for structured data
- Use enums from the `enum` module for constants and choices
- Use pathlib for file system operations instead of os.path
- Handle exceptions explicitly with try/except blocks
- Use custom exception classes for domain-specific errors
- Use descriptive variable and function names following snake_case convention
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants
- Group imports by standard library, third-party packages, and local modules
- Use absolute imports from the project root
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use context managers (with statements) for resource management
- Use list/dict comprehensions when they improve readability
- Use f-strings for string formatting
- Add docstrings to all classes and functions using Google style
- Use logging module instead of print statements for debugging
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use async/await for I/O operations when beneficial
- Prefer immutable data structures when possible
- Use generators for memory-efficient iteration over large datasets
- Write unit tests with pytest and aim for 100% code coverage
- Use mypy for static type checking
- Use black for code formatting
- Use isort for import sorting
- Use ruff for fast linting
