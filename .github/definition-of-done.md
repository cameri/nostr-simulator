# Definition of Done

This document defines the criteria that must be met for a task to be considered complete in the Nostr Simulator project.

## Code Quality Requirements

### Code Completion

- [ ] All planned functionality is implemented
- [ ] Code follows the project's coding standards outlined in `python-instructions.md`
- [ ] All functions and classes have proper type hints
- [ ] All public functions and classes have comprehensive docstrings following Google style
- [ ] Error handling is implemented where appropriate
- [ ] Logging is added for debugging and monitoring purposes

### Code Standards Compliance

- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- [ ] No formatting issues when running `black .` and `isort .`
- [ ] No linting errors when running `ruff check .`
- [ ] Type checking passes with `mypy .`
- [ ] No unused imports or variables
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions throughout

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- [ ] Unit tests are written for all new functionality
- [ ] Test coverage is 100% for new code
- [ ] Integration tests are added where appropriate
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions are tested
- [ ] Tests follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

### Test Quality

- [ ] Tests are deterministic and repeatable
- [ ] Tests run successfully in isolation
- [ ] Test names clearly describe what is being tested
- [ ] Mock objects are used appropriately for external dependencies
- [ ] Performance tests are added for critical paths

## Build and Validation

### Successful Build

- [ ] All tests pass when running `poetry run pytest`
- [ ] Test coverage meets requirements when running `poetry run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term`
- [ ] Type checking passes without errors
- [ ] Linting passes without violations
- [ ] Code formatting is consistent

### Integration Validation

- [ ] New code integrates properly with existing codebase
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs unless documented
- [ ] Simulation runs successfully with new changes
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show no significant regressions
- [ ] Memory usage remains within acceptable bounds

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation

- [ ] All new classes and functions have docstrings
- [ ] Complex algorithms are explained with inline comments
- [ ] Public APIs are documented with usage examples
- [ ] Configuration options are documented
- [ ] Dependencies and their purposes are documented

### Project Documentation

- [ ] README.md is updated if new features affect usage
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated with a summary of changes
- [ ] API documentation is generated and up-to-date
- [ ] Any new dependencies are justified and documented

## Review and Quality Assurance

### Code Review

- [ ] Code has been reviewed by at least one other developer (when applicable)
- [ ] All review comments have been addressed
- [ ] Security implications have been considered
- [ ] Performance implications have been evaluated
- [ ] Maintainability and readability have been assessed

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Feature works as specified in requirements
- [ ] No known bugs or issues remain
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] Code is ready for production deployment
- [ ] Rollback plan exists for significant changes

## Commands to Verify Definition of Done

Run these commands to verify all requirements are met:

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Type checking
poetry run mypy .

# Linting
poetry run ruff check .

# Formatting
poetry run black --check .
poetry run isort --check-only .

# Testing with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term --cov-fail-under=100

# Run the simulator (smoke test)
poetry run python -m src.main --help
```

## Definition of Done Checklist

Before marking a task as complete, verify:

- [ ] All code quality requirements are met
- [ ] All testing requirements are satisfied
- [ ] Build and validation steps pass
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Code review process is completed (when applicable)
- [ ] All validation commands run successfully

Only when ALL criteria are met should a task be marked as complete with `[x]` in the TODO.md file.
