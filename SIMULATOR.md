# Simulator for Decentralized Anti-Spam and Anti-Abuse Strategies on Nostr

To simulate and evaluate decentralized anti-spam and anti-abuse strategies on Nostr (or similar networks), without increasing centralization and while preserving offline capability, you’ll need a structured simulation framework that models both:
	1.	User behavior and network interaction
	2.	Adversarial strategies (spammers, attackers)
	3.	Defense mechanisms (strategies)

The simulator must be extensible, allowing you to plug in different strategies and attack vectors.

Here’s a breakdown of how to do this, including simulation components, strategy modeling, and comparative evaluation.

🔁 Step-by-Step Simulation Framework

1. Define Actor Types and Behaviors
	•	Honest users: Use the network per protocol spec, occasionally offline, with normal publish/subscribe behavior.
	•	Malicious actors: Attempt different types of spam/abuse:
	•	Sybil attacks (many pubkeys)
	•	Replay/flooding
	•	Link spam or hate content
	•	Offline evasion (abusing when moderation can’t act)
	•	Relays: Apply policies locally (e.g. rate limits, reputation filters).
	•	Clients: Behave per protocol spec, with optional client-side filtering.

Use agents to model these actors, each with adjustable parameters.

2. Model Anti-Spam Strategies

These must not rely on central authorities or constant online presence.

Strategy	Type	Notes
✅ Proof of Work (PoW)	Sender-side	Hashcash-style proof before posting. Harder for spam bots.
✅ Web of Trust (WoT)	Network-side	Use trust graph (follows, likes, reposts) for filtering posts.
✅ Hashchain / Rolling Codes	Sender-side	One-time codes based on secret & time to validate integrity of messages.
✅ Reputation tokens (local)	Relay-side	Tokens are earned and spent on posts. Local only.
✅ Rate limiting (local)	Relay/client	Limit number of events per key/time.
✅ Event age proof	Sender-side	Proof that key is aged (e.g. deterministic signature timestamp).
✅ Group signature schemes	Sender-side	Only members of a group (P2P validated) can post.

These can also be combined (e.g., PoW + WoT + rate limit).

3. Define Attack Vectors

Model different spam/attack strategies to test defenses:

Attack Type	Description
📛 Sybil spam	Many pubkeys flood relays
💥 Burst spam	Short bursts of high-velocity posts
🧩 Hash-link spam	Posting harmful links via obfuscation
🔁 Replay attack	Replay old events on new keys
🌐 Offline abuse	Spammer posts while disconnected from moderation relays

4. Implement Simulation Engine

Use a discrete event simulation framework (or build your own lightweight engine). Components:
	•	Node graph: Relays, users, messages
	•	Event queue: Posts, filters, spam attempts
	•	Offline/online state toggling
	•	Metrics collection

Suggested tooling:
Python + SimPy or custom JS agent model + D3.js for visualization.

5. Evaluation Metrics

Evaluate each strategy (and combo) on:
	•	✅ False positives: Good messages blocked
	•	✅ False negatives: Bad messages passed
	•	⚙️ Relay load: Bandwidth, CPU
	•	⏳ Latency: Delay added by strategy
	•	📉 Spam reduction %
	•	🧷 Resilience to offline abuse
	•	🛡 Sybil resistance

🧪 Example Strategy Test

Scenario:
	•	500 users, 5% are spammers
	•	100 relays
	•	3 attack types: Sybil + replay + offline abuse
	•	Test PoW + WoT vs Rate limiting only

Result Summary (sample simulated data):

Strategy	Spam Reduction	False Pos	Relay Load	Works Offline
PoW + WoT	93%	Low	Medium	✅
Rate Limiting	70%	Medium	Low	✅
WoT Only	75%	High	Medium	❌ (needs online graph)


⸻

📌 Notes on Implementation
	•	Offline support: Any strategy that requires shared reputation, trust graphs, or relay-wide consistency must be usable in eventual consistency mode.
	•	No central authority: Use peer-reviewed, cryptographically verifiable schemes (e.g., PoW, hashchain validation).
	•	Extensibility: Allow plug-and-play testing of new strategies or attacker behaviors.

🔚 Final Thoughts

You can build a modular agent-based simulator that lets you plug in combinations of strategies and test them under realistic attack conditions. The goal is to empirically test trade-offs like user burden vs. spam resistance, all without sacrificing Nostr’s core values: censorship resistance, decentralization, and offline usability.
